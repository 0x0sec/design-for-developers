# Design for Developers

Workshop materials for my Design for Developers workshop. Sometimes it seems like designing is an unlearnable skill, or that if you’re a developer, you might not be able to learn it because it’s a different discipline. Luckily, designing has rules just like development does — rules that can be understood both in theory and in practice. In this workshop, learn to how to become self-sufficient for the entire process of execution from concept to design to implementation. This workshop is also ideal for those that want to be a better collaborator to their design counterparts, and better able to execute the creation of complex and beautiful Frontend experiences.

An online version of this workshop is available at [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/design-for-devs/).
